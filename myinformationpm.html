                    In our pandemic response project, we've created a "Mask Control" system using CNN and machine learning to detect face masks accurately. Operating in crowded places like hospitals and transport hubs, this system enhances safety. By utilizing the "Face Mask Detection Dataset," we gathered, scaled, and processed data for model training. Our project's outcome includes visualized results, demonstrating the successful integration of the system into everyday life.</div>
